# keeneyes-landing

Landing page for Keeneyes - behavioral intelligence for professional relationships.

## Run it

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens on http://localhost:8000

## What it shows

A Mac app that records conversations and reveals the behavioral patterns everyone else misses. Three scenarios:
- Founder realizing their board member lost faith months ago
- Developer relations seeing through "evaluation" theater
- Consultant recognizing they're being hired as an alibi, not advisor

The interface shows real-time conversation intelligence - not just transcription, but the hidden dynamics and unspoken motivations that actually drive professional outcomes.

## Tech

Plain HTML/CSS/JS with Tailwind. No build process. Python HTTP server for local dev.

Mobile-responsive with distinct experiences for desktop (Mac app mockup) vs mobile (simplified comparison).
